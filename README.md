# Happy-Sad Image Classifier

This project is a simple deep learning-based image classifier that distinguishes between happy and sad expressions. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and trained on a labeled dataset of images.

## Features
- Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for binary classification.
- Preprocessed image data using TensorFlow data pipeline.
- Trained on labeled happy and sad images.
- Evaluates model performance on a test dataset.
- Makes predictions on new unseen images.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/happy-sad-classifier.git
   cd happy-sad-classifier
   ```
   ```

## Usage
- Modify the dataset path to include your own images.
- Train the model using the provided notebook.
- Test the classifier on new images.

## Results
The model achieves good accuracy in distinguishing between happy and sad expressions. Future improvements can include using a larger dataset and data augmentation for better generalization.
